Sorting Machine - Carl Guo and Joel Zhang

This program is meant for the programmer to play around with the sorting algorithms given. The runner prompts the user with 
two options: Sort an array and compare runtimes. When sorting an array, the program will prompt four options for the user: quicksort, 
bubblesort, insertionsort, and mergesort. Compare runtimes will compare and display the runtimes of each of these algorithms on an 
unsorted array.
