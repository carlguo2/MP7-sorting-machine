This is a simple sorting machine.
Made by Joel Zhang (netID jz32) and Carl Guo (netID)


You can use this to sort data array with four sorting methods:
-Insertion sort;
-Bubble sort;
-Quick sort;
-Merge sort;
and the console will tell you how each method sorts the data.
Besides, each call to each method will give you expected best case runtime and worst case runtime in big O notation, 
and after calling not only sorted array is returned but also specific process of every steps are shown in order to tell you
 how the method sorts the data.You can also compare the running time among different sorting methods and watch which one would 
 be the fastest way with given data size.
